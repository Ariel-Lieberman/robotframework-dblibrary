/**
 * This library supports database-related testing using the Robot Framework. It
 * allows to establish a connection to a certain database to perform tests on
 * the content of certain tables and/or views in that database. A possible
 * scenario for its usage is a Web-Application that is storing data to the
 * database based on some user actions (probably a quite common scenario). The
 * actions in the Web-Application could be triggered using some tests based on
 * Selenium and in the same test it will then be possible to check if the proper
 * data has ended up in the database as expected. Of course there are various
 * other scenarios where this library might be used.
 * 
 * As this library is written in Java support for a lot of different database
 * systems is possible. This only requires the corresponding driver-classes
 * (usually in the form of a JAR from the database provider) and the knowledge
 * of a proper JDBC connection-string.
 * 
 * The following table lists some examples of drivers and connection strings
 * for some popular databases. 
 * Database | Driver Name | Sample Connection String | Download Driver | MySql |
 * com.mysql.jdbc.Driver | jdbc:mysql://servername/dbname | http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ |
 * oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver | jdbc:oracle:thin:@servername:port:dbname | http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/htdocs/jdbc_faq.html |
 * 
 * The examples in the description of the keywords is based on a database table
 * named "MySampleTable" that has the following layout:
 * 
 * MySampleTable: | COLUMN | TYPE | | Id | Number | | Name | String | | EMail |
 * String | | Postings | Number | | State | Number | | LastPosting | Timestamp |
 * 
 * NOTE: A lot of keywords that are targeted for Tables will work equally with
 * Views as this is often no difference if Select-statements are performed.
 *
